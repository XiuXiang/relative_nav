# relative_nav
A RGB-D vision-based, GPS-denied navigation and control architecture for a rotorcraft platform.  Written in C++ and ROS.  The original code was written for ROS Fuerte and efforts are currently being made to update this original branch to a more recent/relevant ROS distribution.  

The original code, written by Robert Leishman, is in the Public Domain. This work was completed by Robert Leishman while performing official duties as a federal government employee with the Air Force Research Laboratory and is therefore in the public domain (see 17 USC § 105). Public domain software can be used by anyone for any purpose, and cannot be released under a copyright license.

However, all software in the Master Branch was not written by Robert Leishman and does come with copyrights.  Copyrighted software (and associated copyright information) is found in the following nodes/folders: cereal_port, control_toolbox, mikro_serial
