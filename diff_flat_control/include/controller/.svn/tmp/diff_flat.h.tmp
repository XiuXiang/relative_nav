 *  \class DiffFlat diff_flat.h "include/controller/diff_flat.h"
 *  \brief This class implements a differentially flat position controller for MikroKopter vehicles. It is based on the
 *  paper: "Differential Flatness-Based Control of a Rotorcraft for Aggressive Maneuvers" by
 *  Ferrin J., Leishman R., Beard R., and McLain T. IEEE IROS Sept. 2011.
 *
 *  This implementation expands the controller identified in the paper by allowing waypoint paths to be followed.
 *  The paper only discusses following twice-differentiable, time-dependent paths.
 *
 *  The controller states are position, linear velocity (in same frame as position), and yaw: [f s d fdot sdot ddot psi]
 *  In my current application, these will be relative to the current node that the estimator is navigating with respect to.
 *  This node can change, and the waypoints must be expressed in the new node frame when that occurs.
 *  However, as long as the waypoints and the state are in expressed in the same coordinate frame, this controller
 *  should work fine.  So this controller should work fine using motion capture data
 *  UPDATE: I have used this controller to fly the hex using truth data around the CAVE.  I still have yet to try it
 *  using relative states though...
