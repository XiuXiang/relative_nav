\b kinect_vo2 is a package that provides view matching for kinect image and depth data.  View matching is used here instead of visual odometry,
as the algorithm compares the current image to a reference image instead of to the previous image.  Reference images are set when the the camera 
has moved or yawed a sufficient distance to where the matching degrades.  If two frames are dropped in succession, a new reference will be declared
and the algorithm will try to recover.  Nonlinear Least-Squares Bundle Adjustment (via g2o) can be enabled to optimize the outputs.

The main classes are as follows:
<ul>
<li>ROSServer - Provides the interface with ROS and runs the main loop. It recieves all the sensor data and publishes 
the estimates and calls the estimator when data has arrived.</li>
<li>Estimator - Implements the MEKF. </li>
<li>Constants - Contains the #defines for deciding whether or not to estimate the calibration constants and all the other 
constants that are used in the estimation. </li>
</ul>
