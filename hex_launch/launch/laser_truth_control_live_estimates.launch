<!-- 
  This launch file starts everything to be able to run the estimator live, based on onboard sensors only, and
  to run the control based on the truth.  It runs the path planner (based on truth and RGB-D), so that the 
  hex will follow paths if they are computed (need an input navigation goal from RVIZ or something else)
