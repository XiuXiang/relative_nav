\b hex_launch 


Provides convienient launch files for running all the required programs to do experiments with our relative 
navigation indoor flying platform.  The launch folder is partitioned into background stuff ('includes' folder) 
which launchs stuff like truth from Cortex or the Openni nodes; planning stuff ('planning' folder) which has
higher level launch files to do demos for the path planner, and visual odometry stuff ('VO' folder) to take
datasets for the visual odometry.  Main launch files that include everything will be placed in the launch
folder.  

The rosbags folder contains scripts to start rosbags for different topics.  They are called within the launch files.
