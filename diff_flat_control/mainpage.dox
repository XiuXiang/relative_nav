\b Diff_Flat_Control is an implementation of the differential flatness controller described in the work by 
Ferrin J., Leishman R., McLain T., and Beard R., "Differential Flatness-Based Control of a Rotorcraft 
for Aggressive Maneuvers" in IEEE IROS Sept. 2011. 

This controller provides the ability to follow predefined twice-differentiable paths, hover in place, and follow 
a list of waypoints.  This control can be done in a global coordinate frame, such as that of a motion capture system,  
or using a relative coordinate frame, like those produced using the rel_MEKF. As such, it listens for topics from 
those two sources (motion capture truth or rel_MEFK state messages), computes the control, and then outputs a 
message for cyphy_serial_driver to deliver to the Mikrokopter autopilot.  

Note that the matlab script /Matlab/LQR_script_heavy.m computes the gain matrices and writes them to the file 
"HeavyGainMatricies.txt", which is then read into the program and used for the control.  One can adjust the gains 
by changing the parameters for Bryson's Rule in that matlab script.

The main classes are as follows:
<ul>
<li>ROSServer - Provides the interface with ROS. It recieves the truth or relative data and publishes 
the control messages.</li>
<li>DiffFlat - Implements the differential flatness controller.  Additional paths to be followed can be
inserted here.  Follow the format outlined by the circle path. </li>
</ul>
